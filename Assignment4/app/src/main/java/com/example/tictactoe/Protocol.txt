My protocol is dumbfoundedly simple. 

When attempting to connect, a client prefers to join half-full groups

After establishing a connection to a new or half-full (1/2) Group, the second player to connect always goes first

The only message type during "GamePlay" is in the form of two numbers,separated by a space, representing the Row and Column of the play

"MSG,<ROW> <COL>"

Before sending this message, the client verifies two things
1. That it is its own turn (boolean bIsMyTurn)

2. That the play value is not already taken
